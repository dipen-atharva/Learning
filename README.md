# What is the role of the package.json?

=> The package.json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.

# All package managers

(1) npm (Node Package Manager):

npm is the default package manager for Node.js and JavaScript. It's widely used for managing dependencies and scripts in Node.js projects.

(2) Yarn:

Yarn is a fast, reliable, and secure alternative to npm. It caches packages to improve performance and resolves dependencies more deterministically.

(3)pnpm:

pnpm is another package manager for Node.js that uses a single global store for all packages, which helps in saving disk space and improving installation times.

(4) Bower:

Bower is a package manager specifically designed for front-end libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, etc.

(5) Bolt:

Bolt is a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. It provides features for versioning, linking packages locally, and optimizing workflows.

(6) Verdaccio:

Verdaccio is a lightweight private npm proxy registry. It allows organizations to host their own npm registry to cache packages and manage access.

(7) Lerna:

Lerna is a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. It optimizes the workflow around managing changes across multiple packages in a single repository.

(8) Nest:

Nest is a package manager for Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It allows developers to manage Deno modules similar to npm for Node.js.

(9) ESLint:

ESLint is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript. While not a package manager per se, it helps developers enforce coding styles and detect errors.

(10) pnpx:

pnpx is a command-line tool that comes with pnpm. It allows running npm or Yarn binaries directly from the npm registry without installing them locally.
